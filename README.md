# Lime Bootstrap

For usage docs, please visit [lime-bootstrap.com](https://www.lime-bootstrap.com)

## Docs
The docs are built with [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) with the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Mkdocs requires Python and we are using 3.6 to build


Install into a venv or not
```bash
$ pip install -r docs/requirement.txt
```

Serving the docs locally with `npm run docs`

Publishing docs to Github-pages (requires push access to repo) `npm run publish-docs`
