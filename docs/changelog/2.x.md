# Changelog for Lime Bootstrap 2

## 2.0.0
Lime Bootstrap is a major rewrite of most of Lime Bootstrap. We have moved to a reliable build and packaging and improved tooling. Foundation for new exciting features has been set, such as moving to components and new datasources for the REST-api.

## Changes
- Dependencies are managed with npm
- ES6 is used and transpiled with Babel
- Bundling is moved from Gulp to Brunch.io
- Tests are added with Jest
- Base views are no longer dynamically loaded
- Docs and website have been modernized
- Old debug view is removed and replace with good old Firebug Lite. The chromium debugger will be final replacement.
- Version checking of apps and framework is removed, versioning through `limeplug` is the replacement
- Better support for being used inside Chromium
- Moved most dependencies to latest version, exceptions are Bootstrap and Font Awesome
- LBS can be run fully decoupled from VBA

### New functionality
- Added new built in [components](/included_components)
- Added new [data sources](/datasources) to use the REST-api and Custom endpoints

### Breaking changes
* `xml2json` has been replaced and functions a tiny bit differently. It just takes a string representing a XML-object as its sole parameter
* `loadDataSource` has been changed to return the result instead of merging of the supplied model, i.e `data = loadDataSource(...)`. Old way still works, but is strongly discouraged.
