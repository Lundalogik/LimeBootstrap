#Changelog for Lime Bootstrap 2

## 2.0.0
Lime Bootstrap is a major rewrite of most of Lime Bootstrap. We have moved to a reliable build and packaging and improved tooling. Foundation for new exciting features has been set, such as moving to components and new datasources for the REST-api.

## Changes
- Dependencies are managed with npm
- ES6 is used and transpiled with Bable
- Bundeling is moved from Gulp to Brunch.io
- Tests are added with Jest
- Base views are no longer dynamically loaded
- Docs and website have been modernized
- Old debug view is removed, chromiums debuger is the replacement
- Version checking of apps and framework is removed, versioning through limeplug is the replacement
- Better support for being used inside Chromium
- Moved most dependencies to latest version, exeptions are Bootstrap and Font Awesome
- LBS can be run fully decopled from VBA

### New functionality
- Added new built in [components](/included_components)
- Added new [data sources](/datasources) to use the REST-api and Custom endpoints
- Building apps are replace by building [custom components](/custom_components)

### Breaking changes
* `xml2json` has been replaced and functions a tiny bit differently. It just takes a string representing a XML-object as its sole parameter
* `loadDataSource` has been changed to return the result instead of merging of the supplied model, i.e `data = loadDataSource(...)`
