# Data sources

A core concept in Lime Bootstrap is data sources. A data source is just what it sounds like, a source of data. The source can be many things, like a Lime Inspector, a REST web-service, a stored procedure or a VBA function. Data sources are used both while working with basic views and especially when working with apps.

All datasources  takes a paramter `type` and then some other source specific params.

All source can also take a parameter __"alias"__, which lets you specify a name for the data source in ViewModel. This might be usefull if you have multiple sources on the same table wich may otherwise will cause naming collisions.

### Example:

```javascript
 dataSources:
        [
            {type: 'activeInspector'},
            {type: 'localization'},
            {type: 'relatedRecord', source: 'person', view: 'name;phone' , alias: 'contact'},
            {type: 'storedProcedure', source: ''}
        ],

```
## Data sources

### activeLimeObject
Fetch data from the Lime CRM api for the currently active LimeObject


```
{ type: 'activeLimeObject' , embed: ['coworker']}

```

| Param              | Description                         | Default | Required |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| type               | Type of the data source             |         | true     |
| embed              | Related objects to embed            | []      | false    |

Embed fetches data from related objects. It only works for `belongs_to` properties.

!!! Note
    The returned data is almost identical to the answer from the Lime CRM API with one important exception, embedded objects. To make embedded data easier to use directly in a View we push the data from the `_embeded`-node to a `[your object here]-node. 


## Legacy data sources

The legacy datasources fetches data through the use of VBA or directly through the COM-bridge. These datasources are slower, blocking and less compatible with future directions. Avoyd using them or limit your use as much as possible
